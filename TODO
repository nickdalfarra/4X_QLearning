- make model_fitting.py produce transition probabilities for a list of metrics
- implement Q-Learning on one of the stochastic kernels

FIXME
- ensure that all metrics are trained on the same data, and that the stochastic kernel is also
    fit to this data

{COMPLETED:
- make Dif2 metric child class

}
